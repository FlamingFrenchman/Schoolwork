Lab 2: Intro to Logic with MML
Section 01D

If MML did not provide a 7-segment display, I would begin making one by treating each segment
as an individual binary output. They would need to output true or false (off or on) depending
on what specific number is being displayed. Each combination of inputs would have an array of 7
outputs, each corresponding to a segment of the display.

The random number generator probably works by using the system time or unix time
as input for a complex algorithim that creates a pseudorandom number based on this input. Since
this number does not or only rarely repeats, one would have to generate numbers for an extended
period of time before the pattern repeated.

A computer cannot itself be random, but it can use data gathered from its enviornment to simulate
or replicate randomness, such as time or, say, the number of particles emitted by a radioactive
material.

I learned that MML is surprisingly easy, if a bit tedious to use. The most frustrating feature I
found to be that signal senders can't even have the same name between separate pages of a project,
which seems lame and forces me to actually put thought into the names of my components. How dare they.
I was also surprised at how much can be done by using very basic logic gates only. My circuits could
probably be more compact, but as they are now they are fairly readable and not monstrous, while using
nothing more complex than NAND and NOR gates.
