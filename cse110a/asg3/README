This program makes use of examples and utility files found
in the util-code directory, namely:

- auxlib.cpp
- auxlib.h
- string_set.cpp
- string_set.h
- lyutils.cpp
- lyutils.h
- astree.cpp
- astree.h

The main.cpp file also contains code from cppstrtok.cpp

.tok files are now generated correctly according to the spec from last
assignment, i.e. files are written from calls made within yylex
