# `oc` Symbols and Type Checking 
### Robert Bergeron
### ID: `rbergero`

This program makes use of examples and utility files found
in the util-code directory, namely:

- auxlib.cpp
- auxlib.h
- string_set.cpp
- string_set.h
- lyutils.cpp
- lyutils.h
- astree.cpp
- astree.h

The main.cpp file also contains code from cppstrtok.cpp

Some symbols have their type assigned in the astree constructor, which
I hope is okay. Some of the assignments are unecessary or wrong, while
others are for tokens which are guaranteed to have certain types, like
constants and TOK_FUNCTION.

Not functional as of this revision, but the majority of the code is
there.
